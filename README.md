# ⚙️ SETUP

## 📦 Install Dependencies

```
cd c:\Users\shiva\OneDrive\Pictures\Documents\hydrophonics-ai\hydroponics-ai
npm install
```

---

## ▶️ Run Backend + Dashboard

```
npm start
```

Open the dashboard at:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

---

## ▶️ Run the Simulator

```
npm run simulate
```

This sends new sensor data every 3 seconds to the backend and triggers live alerts.

---

# 🧪 TEST SENSOR API

Send sample sensor data using curl:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/sensor \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"temperature":35,"humidity":40,"ph":5.0,"light":100,"waterTemp":22}'
```

---

# 🖥️ DASHBOARD SETUP

```
cd ../dashboard
xdg-open index.html
```

OR (recommended):

```
npm install -g live-server
live-server
```

---

# 🤖 CHATBOT USAGE

In the dashboard chatbot, type:

* `status` → Shows current system data
* `alerts` → Shows detected alerts
* `suggestions` → Shows recommendations

# 💡 SUGGESTIONS MAPPING

| Problem              | Solution                |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Temperature too high | Increase ventilation    |
| Temperature too low  | Increase heating        |
| Humidity too low     | Add mist or water       |
| Humidity too high    | Improve airflow         |
| pH too low           | Add pH up solution      |
| pH too high          | Add pH down solution    |
| Light too low        | Increase light exposure |
| Light too high       | Reduce light intensity  |
